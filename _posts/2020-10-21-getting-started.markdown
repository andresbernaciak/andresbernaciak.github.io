## Purpose
The purpose of this blog is to capture my learning journey to become a self-taught data scientist.  I'll take advantage of LM's 2020 Data Science Challenge to provide the environment (an existing business problem, real world data, and a community willing to help) and plan to learn as many skills as possible including: version control, data wrangling, data visualization, feature engineering, model evaluation and selection, packaging and deployment. Looking forward to the next month!
