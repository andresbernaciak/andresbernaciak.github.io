# Purpose
The purpose of this blog is to capture my learning journey to become a self-taught data scientist, which I've dubbed "from zero to data scientist".  I'll take advantage of LM's 2020 Data Science Challenge to provide the environment (a business problem, real world data, and a community willing to help others) and plan to focus on learning various skills including: version control, data wrangling, feature extraction, machine learning models, validation strategies, model packaging and deployment.
